-----

Currently there is **HTTP** server released. Visit |GraphilityHTTP-link| for more information and documentation.

There exists also graphilityPyClient which is an HTTP server
graphility client that behaves in the same way as *embedded*
database. **You will need to add just 2 lines in your code to make use of it!** Visit |GraphilityPyClient-link| for more information and documentation.


.. note::
    Do you know that GraphilityPyClient test suite uses the same code
    as graphility test suite ?


Here you will find some screen shots from the interface:
